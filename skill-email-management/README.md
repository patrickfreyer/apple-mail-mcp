# Email Management Expert Skill

An expert email management skill for Claude Code that provides intelligent workflows, best practices, and productivity strategies for the Apple Mail MCP.

## What is This?

This is a **Claude Code Skill** that teaches Claude how to be an expert email management assistant. It works together with the Apple Mail MCP:

- **Apple Mail MCP** = The tools (18 email management functions)
- **Email Management Skill** = The expertise (workflows, strategies, best practices)

Together, they create an intelligent email management assistant that knows both what it CAN do (MCP tools) and HOW to do it effectively (Skill knowledge).

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when you mention email management topics in Claude Code:

**Trigger Keywords:**
- "inbox management"
- "email organization"
- "email triage"
- "inbox zero"
- "organizing emails"
- "managing mail folders"
- "email productivity"
- "checking emails"
- "workflow optimization"

**Example Queries:**
- "Help me achieve inbox zero"
- "How should I organize my project emails?"

- "Find all emails from John about the Alpha project"
- "What's the best way to handle my email workflow?"
- "Clean up old emails"

Claude will now:
1. Recognize these as email management requests
2. Load the Email Management Skill expertise
3. Use the Apple Mail MCP tools intelligently
4. Follow best practice workflows
5. Provide actionable suggestions with specific tool commands

## How It Works

### Before the Skill
```
User: "Help me organize my inbox"
Claude: *Calls list_inbox_emails tool*
        *Shows email list*
        "Here are your emails"
```

### After the Skill
```
User: "Help me organize my inbox"
Claude: *Loads Email Management Skill*
        *Calls get_inbox_overview for situational awareness*
        *Analyzes inbox state*
        *Suggests appropriate workflow (triage, inbox zero, or organization)*
        *Provides step-by-step guidance*
        *Offers best practices and next steps*
```

## Features

### Intelligent Workflows
The skill provides battle-tested workflows for common scenarios:
- Morning inbox check (10 min)
- Daily filing routine (15 min)
- Weekly maintenance (30 min)
- Vacation recovery (1-2 hours)
- Bulk cleanup operations

### Tool Orchestration
The skill knows how to combine MCP tools effectively:
- When to use `get_inbox_overview()` vs `search_emails()`
- How to batch operations for efficiency
- When to export before cleanup
- How to safely delete emails
- When to flag vs. move vs. draft

### Context-Aware Suggestions
Based on your inbox state, the skill provides relevant advice:
- "You have 200 unread - let's start with triage"
- "Top sender is newsletters - consider unsubscribing"
- "Flagged items accumulating - schedule review time"
- "This folder has 500 emails - time to archive"

### Safety First
The skill enforces safety practices:
- Always respects max_moves/max_deletes limits
- Suggests exporting before bulk deletion
- Confirms destructive operations
- Provides reversible alternatives (trash vs. permanent delete)

## Customization

You can customize the skill for your needs:

1. **Edit SKILL.md** - Modify core workflows and principles
2. **Add examples/** - Create new workflow documents
3. **Update templates/** - Add your own workflow patterns
4. **Adjust descriptions** - Change trigger keywords in frontmatter
